About the project
=================

This project extends my web-base-frontend project with a fullscreen processing.js script set
up in public/processing/initial.pde. Get started fast with the following commands - after
node and npm have been installed:

    npm install
    npm start

Now, you can easily edit the ProcessingJS code in: public/processing/initial.pde

**Have fun!**
