About the project
=================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/monokrome/processing_test.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

I'm just messing with Processing.JS. Feel free to ignore it, or get started fast
with the following commands - after node and npm have been installed:

    npm install
    npm start

Now, you can easily edit the ProcessingJS code in: public/processing/initial.pde

**Have fun!**
